NoSuchElement - unable to find the locators on webpage may be because of wrong xpath/id  - write correct locators
elementNotvisibale - element avaiable in DOM but not visable, wait for until elemnt visiable
elenmentNotfound  - Mab be element present in frames - driver.switchTo().frame();
StaleElement - page got refreshed or element got refreshed, 


Program to count the occurrence of a specific word in the sentence
Make XPath for locating specific column in dynamic web table
//input[@id = 'value']
//*[contains(@id, 'value')]
//*[contains(text(), 'value')]
//*[text() = 'value']
//*[start-with(@id = 'value')]
//*[@id = 'value' and @class = 'value'][2]
//*[name() = 'svg']//*[local-name() = 'tagName']
//*[name() = 'svg']//*[local-name() = 'tagname']


Validate the color of the progress bar at different points for eg:- at 100% it becomes green and before that it remains orange so how will u validate that green color has appeared?

Load a new web page in the current browser window. 
This is done using an HTTP POST operation, 
and the method will block until the load is complete (with the default 'page load strategy'. 
This will follow redirects issued either by the server or as a meta-redirect from within the returned HTML. 
Should a meta-redirect "rest" for any duration of time, it is best to wait until this timeout is over, 
since should the underlying page change whilst your test is executing the results of future calls 
against this interface will be against the freshly loaded page. Synonym for org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver.Navigation.to(String).
