POM: Design Pattern
===> Hybrid FW + POM (SRP)
POM: 
Page: 
- for every page in web/mobile app, we need to create separate page java class.
- never use assertions in page class.
- page actions need to provide the page behaviour.
- page locators(BY) should be private and will be accessed via public page actions.

Test:
-- have to use a test client : TestNG/Junit/Pytest/Nunit/Jasmine/Mocha
-- assertions should be written in test class
-- never use driver apis in test class

Maven Project

/**
	 * This mehtod is used to initialize the webdriver
	 * 
	 * @param browserName
	 * @return this will return the driver
	 */

/**
	 * this method is used to initialize the properties
	 * 
	 * @return this will return properties prop reference
	 */
